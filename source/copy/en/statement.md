# Statement

My practice explores the tension between material permanence and human fragility. Through sculpture and drawing, I investigate form as a site of memory — where weight, density and gesture hold emotional residue.

Working primarily with bronze and marble, I approach material not as a neutral medium but as an active collaborator. Each surface resists, absorbs and transforms intention. The process becomes an excavation: revealing what is concealed within mass, time and touch.

My work moves between figuration and abstraction, questioning the boundary between presence and absence. Volume is not only physical — it carries silence, compression and latent movement. I am interested in how matter can embody psychological space.

There is a dialogue in my practice between tradition and contemporaneity. Classical techniques are not nostalgic references but structural tools — frameworks that allow disruption, fracture and reinterpretation. The work exists in that friction.

Ultimately, I see sculpture as an act of endurance: a slow construction of meaning within material constraints. Each piece is an attempt to translate internal landscapes into tangible form — where solidity becomes vulnerability and permanence becomes a question.
